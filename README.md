Data-science-Machine-Failue-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting machine failures in industrial environments using machine learning techniques. By analysing historical sensor data, operational parameters, and environmental conditions, the model helps identify potential failures in advance. This enables predictive maintenance, reduces downtime, lowers operational costs, and improves workplace safety.

Key Features:
-Uses real-time and historical sensor data (temperature, pressure, air quality, RPM, current, etc.)
-Binary failure prediction (Failure = 1, No Failure = 0).
-Data preprocessing including cleaning, normalisation, and feature engineering.
-Multiple machine learning models evaluated (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network).
-Predictive maintenance support for proactive decision-making.
-Scalable and integrable with industrial monitoring systems.

Results:
The Random Forest model showed the best performance, achieving high accuracy and reliability in predicting machine failures. It successfully detected early failure patterns, helping reduce unplanned downtime and improve maintenance efficiency.
